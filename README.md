# Project RedgarQuadcopter: Autonomous Drone for Personal and Campus Security
This is my 11th Grade main project. This drone project had the following constraints, to be able to follow it's owner autonomously in the air, make sure it's owner is healthy or safe whether it is alerting others or calling authorities, and it needs to be able to be cheap and fly for about 15 minutes with no break.
