# Project RedgarQuadcopter: Autonomous Drone for Personal and Campus Security
This is my 11th Grade main project and I plan to continue revising and creating iterations of the drone. The drone shows promise and is still very early stage.

Specifics right now: Autonomous flight with following of a user for 12 minutes, a 3 foot by 6 foot flight distance from the user, and a 60% accuracy in determining the user's posture and safety.

Specs: Raspberry Pi 4, Python's OpenCV and Firebase for communications with Phone, Linux, CC3D Flight controller, Librepilot Firmware and a 3500 mAh LiPo battery.

Code is not made opensource as I may want to commercialize this product in the future.
